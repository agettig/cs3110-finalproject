Manual Testing

Since most of our game uses randomness and user input, we did extensive 
manual testing by running "make play". For our manual testing we tested the
helper functions used in the gamestate turn function. For our tests we looked
at the the state of players before a turn and after a turn. For example, we 
checked to see how plaayer's account balances changed or if cards were added 
or removed from their deck. We numbered all our tests for specific functions
and included a description of what we were testing and looking for and a list
of test cases. For each test case we included the inital condition or input and
an expected and actual output.

1. next_player

   Description: Test the correct order of players throughout the game.
   Precondition - there are at least 2 players in the game For testing
   purposes the list of players will be [p1,p2,p3] 

   Test Cases: 

    a. current player [p1] is not on marriage tile, starter
    home tile, normal home tile, college career tile, or career tile.
    Expected: p2   Actual:p2
    b. current player [p2] is not on marriage tile, starter home tile, 
    normal home tile, college careeer tile, or career tile 
    Expected: p2  Actual: p2

2. life_tile_helper

    Description : Check to see if a life tile was been added to
    the current players turn during their next turn. Note: given the number
    of Life Tiles in the game, players will not run out of tiles, and if so
    error handling is included but can't be tested through manual testing of
    running the game

    Test Cases: 
      a. p1 landed on life tile of graduation with 
      current deck = [Spin to Win: 2, Exemption, Exemption Card] 
      Expected: p1 with deck = [LifeTile: Spin to Win: 2, Exemption, Exemption Card]
      Actual: p1 with deck = [LifeTile: Spin to Win: 2, Exemption, Exemption Card]

3. lawsuit_tile_helper
  
  Description: Test to check if lawsuit function works properly. Check if
  correct players list is printed on terminal of all players except the current
  player. Current player then selects a player to sue from list printed. If 
  chosen player has an exemption card then their account balance won't change
  otherwise, the player will lose $100,000. Checks for a decreasing account 
  balance or if exemption card is removed from player deck.
  Current game players - [p1,p2,p3]

    Test Cases:

    to sue p2. p2 has no exemption card with a deck = [Career: Doctor] and 
    has a current balance of $230,000.
